Overloaded functions, bugfixes 1.27

<br>

## Overlook âœ¨
### Additions
- Added `overload` functions that can redirect to other sub-functions by the number of arguments
- Added anonymous constructors, which do not require a pathname, instead they generate a hex uuid4
- Added `enum` for enumeration on iterables (1.27d)

### Documentation
- Added changelogs

### Improvements
- Made `lam` an anonymous constructor
- Added `multi-each` functionality to the `each` statement, that can combine with `enum` to create a more numeric approach to iterating. (1.27d)
- Made `set` statement NOT create new variables when not finding a pathname.

### Bugfixes
- At parser
  - Made constructing nodes with empty names not allowed
  - Made constructing non-string pathnames / names not allowed
  OBS: You can still do it with `conf`, but it will be fixed later
- At lexer
  - Comments took an extra character fixed (1.27c)
