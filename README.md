# ü¶Å LiON language <img src="./LiON/assets/img/icon/red-large.png" alt="Shell Icon" height="40px">

- LiON is a Node Oriented programming language made to be simple and fun to use. Nodes can represent many programming concepts such as `variables`, `functions`, `builtins` and many others.

<img src="./LiON/assets/img/readme/screenshot-lsi.png" alt="LiON LSI" height="100px">

- Today, the interpreter is written in pure Python, with the code being compiled first to JSON (LiON Compiled Format) then, read and executed by the parser, which, takes care of tree/node operations while also interacting with python.


## Sample scripts and Documentation
- LiON stores samples inside the [samples](./LiON/scripts/samples) directory `%/scripts/samples/`.

- For the formal documentation (indev), please see [this file](./LiON/assets/doc/liondoc.md)

- For the LiON's Last Commit Changelog or (LLVC), see [this file](CHANGELOG.md)
