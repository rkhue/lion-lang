Function masks, more functional features, optimized lexer, 1.28a

## Overlook âœ¨
### Additions
- Added from Python:
  - `avg` for getting the average of all numbers in a given iterable
  - `sum` for getting the sum of all numbers in a given iterable
  - `any` checks if any element of a given iterable is true
  - `all` checks if all elements of a given iterable are true

- Add `reduce` for folding an iterable's elements by a given node
- Add `curry.lion` script at `@scripts` for demonstrating some currying with functions.
- Add `curry` constructor in `@std/construtil.lion` for facilitating currying.
- Added function masks, that is a new way of calling functions in LiON that's more aligned with other programming languages.
  - Example: 
    ```sh
    function add (x, y) {?x + ?y}
    # traditional mask
    echo [add 1 2]
    
    # function mask
    echo add[1 2]      # syntax: <pathname>[arg1 arg2 ...]
    ```
  - Explanation: Both calls are equivalent and produce the same result, we can pass the pathname to be before the arguments, which are enclosed by `[ ]`
  - For now, function masks _do not_ work with nodes whose pathnames are not alphanumeric.
  > **NOTICE:** This is an _experimental_ feature, it's not final and can change/be-removed over the course of time.


### Improvements
- Made `exec` receive an exact amount of arguments.
- Made `lam`, `function` and `saber` constructors allow kwargs so for currying.
- Made the categorizer from lexer optimize single masks in a call. So adding multiple nested masks don't compromise too much performance.
