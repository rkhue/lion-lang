NODE INFORMATION
    name: $
    class: statement
    category: math, logic, operators

DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates and returns the result of a given expression.
    By default, if the first element of a call is of the type 'unk', it defaults to being
    considered as an expression.

    The order of operators can be found at @doc/operators.lion

SYNTAX
    $ <arg> <op> <arg>
    $ <op> <arg>
    $ <*args>
    $ <*args> -> (r: int)
        -> Can be used for rounding the result of an expression
           to a given precision in decimal places
    
    <#arg> <...>
        -> The first element of the call is not of the type
           'unk', that is, it is NOT an undeclared string.

USAGE
    - Simple math
        ```
        var n1 [input.int "Type a number: "]
        var n2 [input.int "Type another: "]

        echo Sum: [$ ?n1 + ?n2]
        ```
    - Logic
        ```
        if [3 < 2] {
            echo "smaller"
        } else {
            echo "bigger"
        }
        ```
